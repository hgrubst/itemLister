Item Lister application
=====================================

This is a small application allowing to add items to a list and view them.

Several areas still need to be improved even though the basic functionality works :
- use play 2.0 form helpers
- put proper validation (related to first point)
- "ajaxify" the application, ie no need to refresh the whole page after adding an item
- scale images that are too big
- allow for updating and deleting items

The current configuration uses a H2 database in memory.
Spring data JPA is used for the persistence layer.
Twitter bootstrap is used for styling.
Jquery is used for javascript.
